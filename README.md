# Java Repository

## Description

This is a Java repostory containing all my Java code covering wide range of concepts from basic functions, controlflow, working with arrays, all the way to more advanced concepts, such as OOP, inheritance, abstraction etc.

<br>
These projects and exercises were chosen from free materials on the internet, tasks and assignements from university as well as some paid courses.
<br>
NOTE: The task assignement is usually part of the Java Class file itself or sometimes it is included with the project as a .txt file.

<br><br>
NOTE: Not included yet, work in progress
<br>
This repository also includes my work with Spring framework and Spring Boot, work with databases such as MySQL and much more!
